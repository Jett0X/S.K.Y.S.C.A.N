##  "SMART KINETIC YONDER SURVEILLANCE DRONE- BASED SENSOR UTILIZATION SYSTEM FOR CRISIS ASSESSMENT AND NAVIGATION"

<h4>
The study investigated the impact of using a drone equipped with passive infrared sensor equipment on earthquake rescue operations. Data was collected through design, development, testing, and integration. The system's accuracy, efficiency, and robustness were analyzed. ANOVA was used to assess variations in victim detection across altitudes. The results can be
used to optimize drone performance in disaster scenarios and enhance the overall rescue process.

<h4>
The purpose of this experimental study is to test the efficiency of the drone-based earthquake rescue detection system equipped with a Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, Microphone Sensor and powered by Arduino Uno R3. Utilizing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, the study aims to statistically assess the influence of different altitudes on the number of buzzer alerts to test the frequency and accuracy of the device. The chosen statistical method allows the exploration of significant differences in victim detection means across various altitude levels. The prototype of the drone system was developed through a methodological approach involving an extensive review of relevant literature and instructional resources, including scholarly articles. After fabrication, the researchers conducted rigorous testing to identify any shortcomings or errors in the prototype. The insights gained from this study aim to optimize drone performance in disaster scenarios, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of earthquake rescue operations.
